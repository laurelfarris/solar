\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Bright points are located in the junctions between supergranules in the solar
photosphere. These are thought to be a result of magnetic flux tubes moving to
these junctions after rising to the surface and being jostled about by
advection (source: class notes?). Though they only cover about 1.6 \% of the
visible surface (\cite{Srivastava}), bright points (together with sunspots)
contribute over 90\% of the total magnetic flux (\cite{Howard}).

Over the course of the solar cycle, they can contribute significantly to the
global intensity variation of the sun, particularly in the ultraviolet
regime (\cite{Riethmuller}). UV flux from bright points can be studied using
their coronal counterparts.

These bright points can be seen in the upper layers of the solar atmosphere in
the form of coronal bright points. The cross-sectional area of these BPs is
known to increase in height as the density decreases and temperature increases
(source).

\cite{Alipour} developed an algorithm to locate BPs in the corona, using size determined
by intensity as part of the criteria for distinguishing BPs from other features,
such as top-down views of coronal loops or nanoflares.


\section{Data}\label{data}
This analysis was carried out using data from AIA/\textit{SDO}.
A grayscale image of the full disk at the start of the time series () is shown
in figure \ref{full}.
A single coronal bright point was located and analyzed in each passband.
Each of these wavelengths corresponds to emission
from a different ion, hence a different temperature/height above the
photosphere.

The relevant values for each passband are given in table \ref{temps}.

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}
The intensity of each BP as a function of radius gives a rough visual estimate
of the size of the BP.
For this project, the size was estimated by running a cross-correlation between
a pixel roughly in the center of the BP and the remaining pixels over the
100 $\times$ 100 pixel$^{2}$ area through the full hour long time series.
The central pixel was determined by locating the brightest pixel in the center
of the BP from the first image in the time series.

\section{Results}\label{results}
Images illustrating the highest cross-correlation value of each pixel and the
timelag corresponding to that correlation value are shown in figures \ref{cc_all}
and \ref{tt_all}. The correlation was cut off at 0.5 and rescaled to obtain a
better illustration of the structure of the BP. These images are shown in
figures \ref{cc} and \ref{tt}.

As \cite{Alipour} noted, the BP structure is most evident for the
131\AA{}, 193\AA{}, and 211\AA{} images.

The 211\AA{} data is particularly notable as it shows strong correlation values
at two points to the right of where the BP appears visually in figure \ref{full}.
A movie showing all images from this wavelength (\cite{ssw}) revealed a flash
of emission around the ?th image, which matches the timelag at which the high
correlation values occurred.
