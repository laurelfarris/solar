\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Bright points in the junctions between supergranules in the solar photosphere
can be seen in the upper layers of the solar atmosphere in the form of coronal
bright points. The cross-sectional area of these BPs is known to increase in
height as the density decreases and temperature increases (source).


\section{Data}\label{data}
This analysis was carried out on data from AIA/\textit{SDO} (\cite{Lemen}).
A grayscale image of the full disk at the start of the time series () is shown
in figure %\ref{}.
A single coronal bright point was located and analyzed in each passband, of
which there were seven total. Each of these wavelengths corresponds to emission
from a different ion, hence a different temperature/height above the solar
photosphere.
An image of the bright point in each of the wavelengths is shown in figure
%\ref{},
also at the beginning of the time series.

The relevant values for each passband are given in table \ref{aia}.

    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
        \hline\hline
        Wavelength [\AA{}] & Temperature [K] & Height [km]\\

        94 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        131 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        171 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        193 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        211 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\

        335 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        1600 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        1700 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\
        4500 & $10^{6}$ & 11\\

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}
The intensity of each BP as a function of radius gives a rough visual estimate
of the size of the BP. Here the estimate was taken a step further, using the
cross-correlation of the BP pixels through the entire time series.
